									<dt>Basics?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Hi, I'm Shourya. I was born in Bombay, but now I stay in Hyderabad, India. My pronouns are he/him/his.</p>
										</dd>
									<dt>Work?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>I'm writing a screenplay for my first film. On the side I work at <a href="https://booyah.live/">Booyah!</a> as an Administrator, and <a href="https://plana.academy/">Plan A Academy</a> as a Social Media Manager. Soon I'll be consulting on projects for <a href="https://sillymonks.com/">Silly Monks.</a> Previously, I worked as at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cielmotionpictures/">Ciel Motion Pictures</a> as an Assistant Director.</p>
										</dd>
									<dt>Politics?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>I always agree with the side that isn't discrimatory, so none as of now. Maybe that'll change.</p>
										</dd>
									<dt>What do you admire in people?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Passionate and brutally critical. I don't care what you're passionate about, wear that on your sleeve and say fuck you to anyone that disagrees.</p>
										</dd>
									<dt>Biggest fear?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Graceful girls, annoying alliterations, and meta humour.</p>
										</dd>
									<dt>Biggest pet peeve?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>I can't stand people who say that physical attraaction doesn't matter in a relationship.</p>
										</dd>
									<dt>Best thing you've ever done to a loved one?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Existed.</p>
										</dd>
									<dt>Worst thing you've ever done to a  loved one?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Again, existed.</p>
										</dd>
									<dt>You seem so cocky and rude, whats your deal?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>I'm acttually insanely anxious on the inside but trying to hold it together makes me seem cocky as hell. That, and the fact that I'm sexy as hell.</p>

									<h2>Reviews</h2>
										<blockquote>If he had the looks, the talent, and the personality, he'd be an awesome guy to hang out with.</blockquote>
										<h4>- Sachit Wadhwa</h4>
										<blockquote>Shourya is a lot like the world's most comfortable bed, in a world where comfort is frowned upon.</blockquote>
										<h4>- Kason Irving</h4>
										<blockquote>Gifted.</blockquote>
										<h4>- III Grade Teacher</h4>
										<blockquote>Shourya, what can I say, he's like the Mona Lisa, someone that stands the test of time and remains youthful about it. He is the only person that can be so completely sexy in every single way. Like seriously, he's perfect. I stare at his ass all day, I smile when he smiles, I laugh when he laughs. I love being around him, he's one of the most warm people I've met. So humble, he never brags at all, I found out he flew a Cessna 172 but not because he told me, but because I asked him. Wonderful character, great person to meet with, great drinker. I'll never break free.</blockquote>
