										<h1>1 - Addiction</h1>
										<h2>APRIL 27 2021</h2>
									</header>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											<p>So let's talk about addiction, I don’t know how to explain this to anyone. I’ve lost so many friends in my life because of who I  was, am, and always will be. I need to come out clean.</p>
											<p>I hope it gives some sense of what my experience is to anyone that feels alone, suffocated, or struggling in general. I also hope this gives people that have a friend suffering from an addiction to understand what it’s like for them.</p>
											<p>The only energy you have from the absolute shithole that is your life, is to fall back into your addiction. Most people call it getting “high” or “fucked” but that couldn’t be further from the truth. one of the most misleading words associated with using.</p>
											<p>I always think of substances as going and sitting in this new room, the best room you could imagine. The room where the air conditioner is perfectly cold and you enter with that fresh breeze in your face. It’s where everything is okay, you feel calm and collected. You can look around the room, you can even thrash the room if you want. You’re free. That's what’s so fucking cool.</p>
											<p>Once you just visit the room a few times, and it’s exactly how you remember it. The downside is that when you stay in that room for too long, you get used to how it feels in there, how nice, calm, and cool it is. You get used to how interesting it is,  how much you enjoy other people when you’re in the room.</p>
											<p><b>But, all good things must come to an end.</b><p>
											<p>The more time you spend in the room, the hotter it gets outside. The lights start to hurt your eyes, the room door handle gets stuck so often and everything is a bit too vibrant and harsh. It seems so rude. Remember all the people you enjoyed when you were in your room? They start to resent you. It gets so bad that you wish you could just be alone. You’re so tired of not having people that like you around anymore and you wish it would end. Well, guess what? It does come true.</p>
											<p>People will try a bit at the start, maybe your significant other might try to start some drama, some people might have sympathy for you. Some people will try to intervene, but pretty soon they'll all move on. But you won't.</p>
											<p>Now you're stuck, like a chinese finger trap. You, sitting in your little room, only that it's not so nice and cool, it’s almost uncomfortable. The chemicals you pumped yourself with aren't as effective any more and you need even more, and maybe because you're starting to deteriorate physically. You feel like you’re having real problems trying to hold your life together.</p>
											<p>When you're not in your room now, you feel lethargic, sick, depressed, nauseous, weak, and shaky like someone sucked all the blood out of you. The worst part is, it's not just physical, emotionally everything around you is just bleak and fucking depressing. Nothing is ever worth anything, and by chance, even if it was, you feel too fucking stupid to do anything about it.<b> Who cares, right?</b></p>
											<p>Now you're trapped in this cycle. There’s no one that trusts you anymore, you've fucked everything up and every relationship ever. The only people you’re in contact with are the people that would sell you out to get hold of a room of their own, but you’re not mad because you'd do the same fucking thing to them.</p>
											<p>Not because you're full of hate, or because you’re salty, not because they're rude or toxic, but you just start to understand that everything else is secondary in your life. You'd be nice and have friends if you could but it never works out that way, so you end up with kind of accomplices, an unpaid intern as a friend. “Friends” based on mutual suspicion.</p>
											<p><b>You have no one to turn to. No one.</b><p>
											<p>You know that feeling when it’s freezing cold outside, and it starts to rain, so you go to your room and turn up the heat after a long day? Well, now that's just a key turn away from opening the front door to your room.</p>
											<p>That's why you can't stop, not because the room is so great, but because everything else has turned to shit outside of the room. You live in a fucking paradox, you would do anything to get your room. Anything at all, but at the same time you wish with all your heart and soul for that wretched room to be extinguished from existence.</p>
											<p>All the normal people you see, you would give anything just to have their roomless normal constant life free from the hold of this thing. You’re so jealous and bitter. How could it be so unfair? It’s all so unfair. You've made yourself these glasses that you wear all the time, glasses that let you view the world through your little hell. You’re so pathetic and you just envy all the people in the other world, their obliviousness, their stupidity, and mainly, their happiness. </p>
											<p><b>Just to be without this room would be the greatest wish you can imagine.</b><p>
											<p>Even if you stop visiting your room (using), that stuff doesn't go away, those effects linger for years. Staying in that room killed something in you, and that’s for sure. It kills a part of you because there always seems to be this fucking stain on you that drags you down, this bile of darkness, and it separates you from having a normal life.</p>
											<p>The depression, the isolation, the loneliness. It never gets easier. Only what could have been if everyone was just as miserable as you.</p>
											<p>If you read this till the end, I appreciate you. This was something that’s very personal to me and I just wanted to help people understand.</p>
											<p>I want people to know what it’s like to be an addict. I want people to stop stigmatising it. I want people to learn that sometimes the best thing you can do for someone else is to let them learn on their own. People die, without a doubt, but they would’ve died anyway without you pushing for an intervention.</p>
											<p>Addicts know they have a problem, they accept they have a problem, and now, they can’t find a way to clear the problem because it’s always two steps forward and six back.</p>
											<p>If you’re friends with an addict, please try to understand where they’re coming from. Realise that just because you both are friends, it doesn’t overpower the feeling of the room.</p>
											<p>I wish you the best of luck, and remember, most addicts will only decide to get help once they’ve hit rock bottom. Not all of them, but most of them are unwilling to change till it takes away everything.</p>
										<h3>My friend is an addict, what can I do to help? </h3>
											<p>Stay away from the fucking movie magic method of dealing with shit. They don’t need an “intervention.” Don’t tell them how pathetic they are, don’t get annoyed or mad when they relapse. Don’t leave them just because you feel like it’s too much for you.<p>
											<p>Addicts need to want to change on their own, if they don’t want to change, you can always just say that you’ll be there for them when they do want to. Keep your word. Trust them, and they’ll trust you.<p>
										<h3>I relapsed and I don’t think I can go on. What do I do?</h3>
											<p>There is nothing to be ashamed about.<b> Relapsing is a part of recovery.</b> Getting clean will never be easy, but if you believe you can do it then you should. I would highly recommend joining NA or AA support groups, there’s a few on Discord, and you can always find one around your area. Shoot me a text on Twitter if you want to join a recovery server.</p>
											<p>So long, and thanks for all the fish!</p>

									<h1>2 - All My Friends</h1>
									<h2>APRIL 29 2021</h2>
								</header>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic12.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>This is me being honest. This isn't a cry for help. This isn't justificatiton. This is me.</p>
									<p>All relationships to me are uncomfortable, no matter how long I've known someone or how much I enjoy their company. This is especially a problem because I'm lonely, but I also don't want to reach out to people and ask them to hang out or chat, because that's just pathetic. Funnily enough, I am the cause and effect of my own problem. Years of doubt, rejection, experiences, and a pinch of salt got me to this stage.</p>
									<p>I know this might sound complicated, but the only way to say this is that <b>I'm never alone, but I'm alone all the time.</b></p>
									<p>In my experience, when you open up about something to someone, they reassure you and let you know that it'll be okay. That's all I thought it would be, however, when I open up to people and they react different to my expectation, it unsettles me. Instead if people telling me that it'll be okay, people instead start trying to fix me. I know that they're just trying to help me and that it's what a "real friend" would do, and I can emotionally connect with them, but I can't fucking stand it.</p>
									<p>There are two reasons all my relationships fall apart, and I am the common denominator. The first reason is that when someone tries to help me instead of reassuring me, I feel like I'm gettting treated like a child. It makes me vulnerable and insecure and to make things worse, even though I know it comes from a place of love, I can never accept it. This brings me to the second reason. I can never accept it because how can you try so hard to fix me when I don't want to fix me myself, how can you sit around all day wasting your time on someone that doesn't want to change. To tell you the truth, people don't fucking change.</p>
									<p>So you might be wondering then, logically if I know all relationships with me fall apart, why don't I just try to fix it? The answer is, I can't because I felt and heard and seen all of this before in a million different ways and in a million different people.</p>
									<p>I hate being lonely, I hate it so much, but it's all I've ever known and now I'm comfortable with it. I'm not happy with it, but I've just accepted it for what it is. Sure, I could try to fix it or actually call someone once in a while but I don't fucking care enough to. If you're reading this entry, chances are we're friends, so I need you to understand this for me, just this once. I can't keep up with you or handle any conversations because I'm aware that all relationships with me are temporary, knowing that, I've given up. A lost cause. If you consider us friends, you need to what you're getting into.</p>
									<p><b>I am Noah's Ark, you are the animals with me. Except the only problem is that I'm not Noah's Ark. I'm the Titanic and my issues are the iceberg.</b></p>
									<p>If you could notice a pattern in your life, you can figure things out effectively. For example, if I ask you to complete this pattern (1 2 3  _ 5), all of you would have said 4. That's because you notice the way it is and how it doesn't change.</p>
									<p>All that I've done is realised that relationships in my life follow the same pattern, and effectively, I don't even try to find another answer.</p>
									<p>I very much love that you are trying to help me, but I promise you I am not the answer to your own problems. Stop trying to fix me. I am not a leaking faucet. I am the ocean and you're diving.<p>
									<p>People trying to help me are like moths and I am the flame that kills them. <b>I hate that people care about me more than I could ever care about myself.</b></p>
									<p>I love you if you're in my life, but here's the issue. I've seen you at your worst and at your worst you're still the best, but at my best I'm still the worst.</p>
									<p>Truth is, I don't want to be helped or fixed because either I won't change and you'll leave or I'll disappoint you and you'll leave. I can't deal with doing that to someone, especially someone putting effort into me when they get fucking nothing out of it.</p>
									<p>It's so fucking stupid that we're brought up by a society that tells us to ask people how they are as a polite gesture, and not as a genuine concern. The response is always expected to be positive.</p>
									<p>Honestly, I see all of you and I see your genuine care. I just can't process it emotionally. It's like I walk around in a balloon and everyone else around me is a nail, and eventually I'll run out of balloons.</p>
									<p>That's all I've got left to say about this, that's all. Show's over.<p>
									<p>Dance, motherfucker, dance the night away.</p>

									<h2>JUNE 16 2021</h2>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic12.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>It’s pretty sad, and I hate everything about it. I’m fine, but I feel like I’ve replaced my heart with metal parts instead. Must be nice to have your mind not act up every time you fuck up everything you’ve ever know.  </p>

<p>It’s like every message sent, every word spoken, every feeling felt, is a million times worse. You’re stuck with this feeling of looming death, like it’s right around the corner,</p>

<p>Like fuck. I can’t even sleep anymore with my head feeling okay. I close my eyes and all I hear are hospital ICU beeps and fucking pain. An immense amount of pain, and it hurts. That’s the worst part. Feeling that feeling is the worst part. The feeling of feeling like dying, then feeling like you’re going to, quickly followed by the feeling of wanting to just to get the feeling to stop.</p>

<p>The feeling of wanting to actively make any and all feelings just stop because you can. Just because you have the power to. The feeling where the pain of living actually outweighs the pain of wanting to die. The feeling of floating into nothingness, not black, not emptiness, just absolute nothing. The feeling of wanting to feel that everyday just for even a second.</p>

<p>It’s the feeling of not wanting to feel. The feeling of wanting to be numb to the world. The feeling of wanting to finally end it.</p>

<p>I don’t want to love anymore, I don’t love anymore. I don’t want to feel happy anymore, I don’t feel happy anymore. I don’t want to feel anymore, I don’t want to feel at all. I hate it. I hate it so much. </p>

<p>Understandable that this might upset people and if it does, fuck you. Honestly from the bottom of my heart, fuck you. Entirely. I’m so sick of you making things about you. My pain is mine and if it hurts you in the process I genuinely no longer care. I’m done caring. I’m don’t want to care. I’m at my fucking limit.</p>

<p>I don’t care. I never wanted to, and now I don’t.</p>
